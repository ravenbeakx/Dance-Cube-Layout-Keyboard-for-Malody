# Dance-Cube-Layout-Keyboard-for-Malody

I am using KiCad to build a 6 key Malody keyboard. This is not a skin, it's a physical mechanical keyborad that you can play Malody with.


## Required Materials

Red Dragon Alien Key Cap and Switches or Kailh Big Switch

Custom PCBs

Find em on AliExpress or smth. I'll make a normal sized version after this XXL one.

Custom casing is optional.
