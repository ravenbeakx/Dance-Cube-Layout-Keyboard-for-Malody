# Dance-Cube-Layout-Keyboard-for-Malody

I am using KiCad to build a 6 key Malody keyboard. This is not a skin, it's a physical mechanical keyborad that you can play Malody with.


## Required Materials

Red Dragon Alien Key Cap and Switches or Kailh Big Switch,or normal switches and keycaps based on what version you want to build.

Custom PCBs

Find em on AliExpress or smth. I'll make a normal sized version after this XXL one.

Custom casing is optional.
